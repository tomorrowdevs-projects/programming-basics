# Contributing

Here are the contribution guidelines for the **TomorrowDevs** projects.

## Creating new projects
New projects must observe the following rules:

1. **They must be language-agnostic**. Problems can be solved in **any** programming language.
2. The user should be able to solve the problem using pseudo-code if their code doesn't compile or throw an error.
3. Every problem must have a README.md file explaining:
4. The problem itself
5. A reference for the student to some documentation that could help them solve the problem
6. Every problem must have one category.
7. Every problem README.md file must implement the [template file](README_TEMPLATE.md).

## Solving a problem
Each solution must be submitted by opening a **pull request**. The pull request must observe the following rules:
1. The branch name should be formatted as `solution/<ms>-<num>-<problem-name>` for example: `solution/m1-001-area-of-a-room`
2. Write your solution in the file in the folder of the programming language you are using to solve the exercise (python/js)
3. You can verify if your solution is correct by manually running the exercise test.
4. Every commit must adopt the conventional commits rules. Learn more [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
5. Open a Pull Request in this repository.
6. The tests will be automatically executed at each Pull Request, where you can see if your solution is correct.
