# Weird Words

Students learning to spell in English are often taught the rhyme “I before E except after C”. 

This rule of thumb advises that when an I and an E are adjacent in a word, the I will precede the E, unless they are immediately preceded by a C. 

When preceded by a C the E will appear ahead of the I. This advice holds true for words without an immediately preceding C such as believe, chief, fierce and friend, and is similarly true for words with an immediately preceding C such as ceiling and receipt. 

However,
there are exceptions to this rule, such as weird.
Create a program that processes a file containing lines of text. 

Each line in the file
may contain many words (or no words at all). Any words that do not contain an E adjacent to an I should be ignored. 

Words that contain an adjacent E and I (in either order) should be examined to determine whether or not they follow the “I before E except after C” rule. 

Construct and report two lists: One that contains all of the words that follow the rule, and one that contains all of the words that violate the rule. 

Neither of your lists should contain any repeated values. Report the lengths of the lists at the end of your program so that one can easily determine the proportion of the words in the file that respect the “I before E except after C” rule.
