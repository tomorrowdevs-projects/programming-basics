#Italian Lotto Game


First part of the project about Italian Lotto Game Reference: https://www.sisal.it/lotto/come-si-gioca

Requirements

    The project must be OOP so that it can be extended in the next learning path
    The software should ask the user how many bills he wants to generate (min: 1, max: 5, 0: exit)
    For each bill the software should ask the type of bill (ambata, ambo, terno, quaterna, cinquina) and the amount of numbers to generate (max 10 per bill) and the "city" (aka "ruota") of the bill: Bari, Cagliari, Firenze, Genova, Milano, Napoli, Palermo, Roma, Torino, Venezia and Tutte (
    Numbers will be randomly generated in the range 1-90 (inclusive)
    Generate the ticket with nice ascii art table decoration (https://ozh.github.io/ascii-tables/)

#How to start

Start the program in your command line interface. Enter the following command:

python3 main.py -n(num)

--> num stands for the number of bills that you want, enter it without parenthesis.
 

The application will ask you the type of bet , the city(aka 'Ruota'), and how many numbers to extract (1 to 10). After that it print out your bills.
