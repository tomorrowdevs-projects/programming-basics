# **LOTTO GAME**

This program generates up to 5 Lotto tickets.

You will be able to choose how many numbers to play for each card, the wheel or wheels, the type of bet you want to make and the amount you want to play.

The program will generate the coupons with the numbers to play, easily printable from a txt file.
