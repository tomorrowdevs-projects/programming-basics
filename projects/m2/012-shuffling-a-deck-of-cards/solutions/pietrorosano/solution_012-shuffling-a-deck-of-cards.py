# Begin by writing a function named createDeck.
# It will use loops to create a complete deck of cards by storing the two-character abbreviations for all 52 cards
# into a list. Return the list of cards as the functionâ€™s only result. Your function will not require any parameters.

# Write a second function named shuffle that randomizes the order of the cards in a list.
# One technique that can be used to shuffle the cards is to visit each element in the list and swap it with another
# random element in the list. You must write your own loop for shuffling the cards. You cannot make use of a shuffle function.
# Use both of the functions described in the previous paragraphs to create a main program that displays a deck of cards
# before and after it has been shuffled.
# Ensure that your main program only runs when your functions have not been imported into another file.

# A good shuffling algorithm is unbiased,
# meaning that every different arrangement of the elements is equally probable when the algorithm completes.
# While the approach described earlier in this problem suggested visiting each element in sequence and swapping it with
# an element at a random index, such an algorithm is biased.
# In particular, elements that appear later in the original list are more likely to end up later in the shuffled list.
# Counterintuitively, an unbiased shuffle can be achieved by visiting each element in sequence and swapping it to a
# random index between the position of the current element and the end of the list instead of randomly selecting any index.
