# List of Proper Divisors

A proper divisor of a positive integer, *n*, is a positive integer less than *n* which divides evenly into *n*. 
Write a function called "proper divisors" that computes all the proper divisors of a positive integer. 
The integer will be passed to the function as its only parameter. 
The function will return a list containing all the proper divisors as its only result. 
Complete this exercise by writing a main program that demonstrates the function by reading 
a value from the user and displaying the list of its proper divisors. 
Ensure that your main program only runs when your solution has not been imported into another file.
