# List of Proper Divisors

A proper divisor of a positive integer, *n*, is a positive integer less than *n* which divides evenly into *n*. Write a function that computes all of the proper divisors of a positive integer. The integer will be passed to the function as its only parameter. The function will return a list containing all of the proper divisors as its only result. Complete this exercise by writing a main program that demonstrates the function by reading a value from the user and displaying the list of its proper divisors. Ensure that your main program only runs when your solution has not been imported into another file.
