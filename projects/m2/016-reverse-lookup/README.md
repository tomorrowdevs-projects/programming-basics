# Reverse Lookup

Write a function named reverseLookup that finds all of the keys in a dictionary that map to a specific value. 
The function will take the dictionary and the value to search for as its only parameters. 
It will return a (possibly empty) list of keys from the dictionary that map to the provided value.
Include a main program that demonstrates the reverseLookup function as part of your solution to this exercise. 
Your program should create a dictionary and then show that the reverseLookup function works correctly when it returns multiple keys, a single key, and no keys. 
Ensure that your main program only runs when the file containing your solution to this exercise has not been imported into another program.
