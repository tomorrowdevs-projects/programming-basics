# Anagrams

Two words are anagrams if they contain all the same letters, but in a different order. 

For example, “evil” and “live” are anagrams because each contains one “e”, one “i”, one “l”, and one “v”. 

Create a program that reads two strings from the user,
determines whether or not they are anagrams, and reports the result.
