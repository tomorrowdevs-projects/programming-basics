/*Write a program that displays the key presses needed for a message entered by the user. 
Construct a dictionary that maps from 
each letter or symbol to the key presses needed to generate it. 
Then use the dictionary to create and display the presses needed 
for the user’s message. For example, if the user enters Hello, World! then your program should output 4433555555666110966677755531111. 
Ensure that your program handles both uppercase and lowercase letters. 
Ignore any characters that aren’t listed in the table above such as semicolons and parentheses.*/
