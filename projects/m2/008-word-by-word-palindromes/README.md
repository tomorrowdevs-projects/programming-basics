# Word by Word Palindromes

A string is a palindrome if it is identical forward and backward. For example “anna”, “civic”, “level” and “hannah” 
are all examples of palindromic words.

Such palindromes examined the characters in a string, possibly ignoring spacing and punctuation marks, 
to see if the string was the same forwards and backwards. 
While palindromes are most commonly considered character by character, 
the notion of a palindrome can be extended to larger units.   
For example, while the sentence 
*“Is it crazy how saying sentences backwards creates backwards sentences saying how crazy it is?”* 
isn’t a character by character palindrome, it is a palindrome when examined a word at a time 
(and when capitalization and punctuation are ignored).  
Other examples of word by word palindromes include 
*“Herb the sage eats sage, the herb”* and *“Information school graduate seeks graduate school information”*.

Create a program that reads a string from the user. 
Your program should report whether or not the entered string is a word by word palindrome. 
Ignore spacing and punctuation when determining the result.
