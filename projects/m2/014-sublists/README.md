# Does a List Contain a Sublist?

A sublist is a list that is part of a larger list. 
A sublist may be a list containing a single element, multiple elements, or even no elements at all.  
For example, [1], [2], [3] and [4] are all sublists of [1, 2, 3, 4].  
The list [2, 3] is also a sublist of [1, 2, 3, 4], but [2, 4] is not a sublist [1, 2, 3, 4] 
because the elements 2 and 4 are not adjacent in the longer list.  
The empty list is a sublist of any list. As a result, [] is a sublist of [1, 2, 3, 4].   
A list is a sublist of itself, meaning that [1, 2, 3, 4] is also a sublist of [1, 2, 3, 4].

In this exercise you will create a function, isSublist, that determines whether or not one list is a sublist of another. Your function should take two lists, larger and smaller, as its only parameters. It should return True if and only if smaller is a sublist of larger. Write a main program that demonstrates your function.
