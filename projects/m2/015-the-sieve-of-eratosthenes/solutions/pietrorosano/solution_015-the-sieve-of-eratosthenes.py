# The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a technique that was developed more than 2,000 years ago to easily find all of the
# prime numbers between 2 and some limit, say 100. A description of the algorithm follows:

# Write down all of the numbers from 0 to the limit Cross out 0 and 1 because they are not prime

# Set p equal to 2

# While p is less than the limit do Cross out all multiples of p (but not p itself)
# Set p equal to the next number in the list that is not crossed out

# Report all of the numbers that have not been crossed out as prime

# The key to this algorithm is that it is relatively easy to cross out every nth number on a piece of paper.
# This is also an easy task for a computerâ€”a for loop can simulate this behavior when a third parameter is provided
# to the range function.

# When a number is crossed out, we know that it is no longer prime,
# but it still occupies space on the piece of paper, and must still be considered when computing later prime numbers.
# As a result, you should not simulate crossing out a number by removing it from the list.
# Instead, you should simulate crossing out a number by replacing it with 0.
# Then, once the algorithm completes, all of the non-zero values in the list are prime.

# Create a program that uses this algorithm to display all of the prime numbers between 2 and a limit entered by the user.
# If you implement the algorithm correctly you should be able to display all of the prime numbers less than 1,000,000
# in a few seconds.
