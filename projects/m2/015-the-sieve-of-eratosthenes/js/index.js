/*The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a technique that was developed more than 2,000 years ago to easily find all 
of the prime numbers between 2 and some limit, say 100. A description of the algorithm follows:
Write down all of the numbers from 0 to the limit Cross out 0 and 1 because they are not prime

Set p equal to 2

While p is less than the limit do Cross out all multiples of p (but not p itself) Set p equal to the next 
number in the list that is not crossed out

Report all of the numbers that have not been crossed out as prime

The key to this algorithm is that it is relatively easy to cross out every nth number on a piece of paper. 
This is also an easy task for a computerâ€”a for loop can simulate this behavior when a third parameter is 
provided to the range function.

When a number is crossed out, we know that it is no longer prime, but it still occupies space on the piece 
of paper, and must still be considered when computing later prime numbers. As a result, you should not 
simulate crossing out a number by removing it from the list. Instead, you should simulate crossing out a 
number by replacing it with 0. Then, once the algorithm completes, all of the non-zero values in the list 
are prime.

Create a program that uses this algorithm to display all of the prime numbers between 2 and a limit entered 
by the user. If you implement the algorithm correctly you should be able to display all of the prime numbers 
less than 1,000,000 in a few seconds.*/
