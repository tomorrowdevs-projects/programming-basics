# Avoiding Duplicates

In this exercise, you will create a program that reads words from the user until the user enters a blank line. 
After the user enters a blank line your program should dis- play each word entered by the user exactly once. 
The words should be displayed in the same order that they were first entered. 

For example, if the user enters:
*first*
*second*
*first*
*third*
*second*

then your program should display:
*first*
*second*
*third*
