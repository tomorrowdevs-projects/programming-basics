# Two Dice Simulation

In this exercise you will simulate 1,000 rolls of two dice. 
Begin by writing a function that simulates rolling a pair of six-sided dice. 
Your function will not take any parameters. 
It will return the total that was rolled on two dice as its only result. 
Write a main program that uses your function to simulate rolling two six-sided dice 1,000 times. 
As your program runs, it should count the number of times that each total occurs. 
Then it should display a table that summarizes this data. 
Express the frequency for each total as a percentage of the number of rolls performed. 
Your program should also display the percentage expected by probability theory for each total.
