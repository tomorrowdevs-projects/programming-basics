/*This exercise examines the process of identifying the maximum value in a collection of integers. 
Each of the integers will be randomly selected from the numbers between 1 and 100. 
The collection of integers may contain duplicate values, and some of the integers between 1 and 100 may not be present. 
Take a moment and think about how you would solve this problem on paper.

Many people would check each integer in sequence and ask themself if the number that they are currently considering is larger than the largest number that they have seen previously. 
If it is, then they forget the previous maximum number and remember the current number as the new maximum number. 
This is a reasonable approach, and will result in the correct answer when the process is performed carefully. 
If you were performing this task, how many times would you expect to need to update the maximum value and remember a new number?

While we can answer the question posed at the end of the previous paragraph using probability theory, we are going to explore it by simulating the situation. 
Create a program that begins by selecting a random integer between 1 and 100. 
Save this integer as the maximum number encountered so far. 
After the initial integer has been selected, generate 99 additional random integers between 1 and 100. 
Check each integer as it is generated to see if it is larger than the maximum number encountered so far. 
If it is then your program should update the maximum number encountered and count the fact that you performed an update. 
Display each integer after you gen- erate it. Include a notation with those integers which represent a new maximum.

After you have displayed 100 integers your program should display the maximum value encountered, along with the number of times the maximum value was updated during the process. 
Partial output for the program is shown below, with... representing the remaining integers that your program will display. 
Run your program several times. Is the number of updates performed on the maximum value what you expected?

74 <== Update
58
17
40
37
13
34
46

80 <== Update

97 <== Update

The maximum value found was 100
The maximum value was updated 5 times*/

const startNumber = Math.trunc(Math.random() * 100);
alert(`Start: ${startNumber}`) // first value

// initialize a variable with the first value and then the highest
let maxNumber = startNumber;
let counter = 0;

for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
   
  let sequenceNumber = Math.trunc(Math.random() * 100);
  
  if (sequenceNumber > maxNumber) {
    alert(`${sequenceNumber} <== Upgrade`)
    maxNumber = sequenceNumber;
    counter += 1; // Check change maximum value
    
  } else {
    alert(`${sequenceNumber}`)
  }
}

alert(`The maximum value was updated ${counter} times`)
