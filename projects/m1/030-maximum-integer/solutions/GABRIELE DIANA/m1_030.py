# Maximum Integer

# This exercise examines the process of identifying the maximum value in a collection of integers. 
# Each of the integers will be randomly selected from the numbers between 1 and 100. 
# The collection of integers may contain duplicate values, and some integers
# between 1 and 100 may not be present.
# Take a moment and think about how you would solve this problem on paper. 

# Many people would check each integer in sequence and ask themselves if the number that they are currently considering
# is larger than the largest number that they have seen previously. 
# If it is, then they forget the previous maximum number and remember the current number as the new maximum number. 
# This is a reasonable approach, and will result in the correct answer when the process is performed carefully. 
# If you were performing this task, how many times would you expect 
# to need to update the maximum value and remember a new number?

# While we can answer the question posed at the end of the previous paragraph using 
# probability theory, we are going to explore it by simulating the situation. 
# Create a program that begins by selecting a random integer between 1 and 100. 
# Save this integer as the maximum number encountered so far. 
# After the initial integer has been selected, generate 99 additional random integers between 1 and 100. 
# Check each integer as it is generated to see if it is larger than the maximum number encountered so far. 
# If it is then your program should update the maximum number encountered
# and count the fact that you performed an update.
# Display each integer after you generate it. Include a notation with those integers which represent a new maximum.

# After you have displayed 100 integers your program should display the maximum value encountered, 
# along with the number of times the maximum value was updated during the process. 
# Partial output for the program is shown below,
# with... representing the remaining integers that your program will display.
# Run your program several times. 
# Is the number of updates performed on the maximum value what you expected?

# 74 <== Update
# 58
# 17
# 40
# 37
# 13
# 34
# 46
# 52
# 80 <== Update
# 37
# 97 <== Update
# 45
# 55
# 73
# ...

# The maximum value found was 100
# The maximum value was updated 5 times
