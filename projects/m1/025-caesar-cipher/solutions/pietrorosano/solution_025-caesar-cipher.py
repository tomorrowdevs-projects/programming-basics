# One of the first known examples of encryption was used by Julius Caesar.
# Caesar needed to provide written instructions to his generals,
# but he didnâ€™t want his enemies to learn his plans if the message slipped into their hands.
# As a result, he developed what later became known as the Caesar cipher.
# The idea behind this cipher is simple (and as such, it provides no protection against modern code breaking techniques).
# Each letter in the original message is shifted by 3 places.
# As a result, A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, D becomes G, etc.

# The last three letters in the alphabet are wrapped around to the beginning: X becomes A, Y becomes B and Z becomes C.
# Non-letter characters are not modified by the cipher.
# Write a program that implements a Caesar cipher.
# Allow the user to supply the message and the shift amount, and then display the shifted message.
# Ensure that your program encodes both uppercase and lowercase letters.
# Your program should also support negative shift values so that it can be used both to encode messages and decode messages.
