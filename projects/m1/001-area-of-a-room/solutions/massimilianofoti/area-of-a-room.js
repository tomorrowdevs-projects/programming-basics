/* Write a program that asks the user to enter the width and length of a room. 
Once these values have been read, your program should compute and display the area of the room. 
The length and the width will be entered as floating-point numbers. Include units in your prompt and output message; 
either feet or meters, depending on which unit you are more comfortable working with. */
