# Decimal to Binary

Write a program that converts a decimal (base 10) number to binary (base 2). 
Read the decimal number from the user as an integer and then use the division algorithm shown below to perform the conversion. 
When the algorithm completes, result contains the binary representation of the number. 
Display the result, along with an appropriate message.

Let *result* be an empty string
Let *q* represent the number to convert 
**repeat**
    Set *r* equal to the remainder when *q* is divided by 2
    Convert *r* to a string and add it to the beginning of result
    Divide *q* by 2, discarding any remainder, and store the result back into *q*
**until** *q* is 0
