# What Color Is That Square?

Positions on a chess board are identified by a letter and a number.  
The letter identifies the column, while the number identifies the row, as shown below:

Write a program that reads a position from the user.  
Use an if statement to determine **if the column begins with a black square or a white square**.  
Then use modular arithmetic to report the color of the square in that row. 
Your program may assume that a valid position will always be entered. 
It does not need to perform any error checking.

Example:  
Input =  a1  
Output = black

Input = d5  
Output = white
