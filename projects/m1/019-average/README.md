# Average

In this exercise you will create a program that computes the average of a collection of values entered by the user. 
The user will enter 0 as a sentinel value to indicate that no further values will be provided. Your program should display an appropriate
error message if the first value entered by the user is 0.

Hint: Because the 0 marks the end of the input it should not be included in the average.
