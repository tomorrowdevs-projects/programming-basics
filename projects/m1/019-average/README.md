# Average

In this exercise you will create a program that **computes the average of a collection of values entered by the user**.   
The user will enter **0 as a sentinel value** to indicate that no further values will be provided. 

Your program should **display an appropriate error message if the first value entered by the user is 0**.  
**Hint**: Because the 0 marks the end of the input it should not be included in the average.
