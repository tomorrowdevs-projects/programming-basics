# It is commonly said that one human year is equivalent to 7 dog years. 
# However this simple conversion fails to recognize that dogs reach adulthood in approximately two years. 
# As a result, some people believe that it is better to count each of the first two human years as 10.5 dog years, and then count each additional human year as 4 dog
# years.
# Write a program that implements the conversion from human years to dog years described in the previous paragraph. 
# Ensure that your program works correctly for conversions of less than two human years and for conversions of two or more human years. 
# Your program should display an appropriate error message if the user enters a negative number.
