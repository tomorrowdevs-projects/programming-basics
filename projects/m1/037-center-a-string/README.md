# Center a String in the Terminal Window

Write a function that takes a string, *s*, as its first parameter, and the width of the window in characters, *w*, as its second parameter. 
Your function will return a new string that includes whatever leading spaces are needed so that s will be centered in the window when the new string is printed. 
The new string should be constructed in the following manner:

- If the length of s is greater than or equal to the width of the window then s should be returned.
- If the length of s is less than the width of the window then a string containing *(len(s) - w)* // 2 spaces followed by s should be returned.

Write a main program that demonstrates your function by displaying multiple strings centered in the window.
