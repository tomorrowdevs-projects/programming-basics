# Capitalize It

Many people do not use capital letters correctly, especially when typing on small devices like smart phones. 
To help address this situation, you will create a function that takes a string as its only parameter and returns a new copy of the string that has been correctly capitalized. 

In particular, your function must:
• Capitalize the first non-space character in the string,
• Capitalize the firstnon-space character after a period, exclamation mark or question mark, and
• Capitalize a lowercase “i” if it is preceded by a space and followed by a space, period, exclamation mark, question mark or apostrophe.

Implementing these transformations will correct most capitalization errors. 

For example, if the function is provided with the string “what time do i have to be there? what’s the address? this time i’ll try to be on time!” 
then it should return the string 

“What time do I have to be there? What’s the address? This time I’ll try to be on time!”. 

Include a main program that reads a string from the user, capitalizes it using your function, and displays the result.
