# Convert an Integer to Its Ordinal Number

Words like *first*, *second* and *third* are referred to as ordinal numbers. 
In this exercise, you will write a function that takes an integer as its only parameter and returns a string containing the appropriate English ordinal number as its only result. 
Your function must handle the integers between 1 and 12 (inclusive). 
It should return an empty string if the function is called with an argument outside of this range. 
Include a main program that demonstrates your function by displaying each integer from 1 to 12 and its ordinal number. 
Your main program should only run when your file has not been imported into another program.
