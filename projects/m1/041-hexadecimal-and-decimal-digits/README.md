# Hexadecimal and Decimal Digits

Write two functions, *hex2int* and *int2hex*, that convert between hexadecimal digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F) and decimal (base 10) integers. The *hex2int* function is responsible for converting a string containing a single hexadecimal digit to a base 10 integer, while the *int2hex* function is responsible for converting an integer between 0 and 15 to a single hexadecimal digit. Each function will take the value to convert as its only parameter and return the converted value as its only result. Ensure that the *hex2int* function works correctly for both uppercase and lowercase letters. Your functions should display a meaningful error message and end the program if the parameter’s value is outside of the expected range.
