# Fizz-Buzz is a game that is sometimes played by children to help them learn about division.
# The players are commonly arranged in a circle so that the game can progress from player to player continually.
# The starting player begins by saying one, and then play passes to the player to the left.
# Each subsequent player is responsible for the next integer in sequence before play passes to the following player.

# On a player’s turn they must either say their number or one of following substitutions:

# If the player’s number is divisible by 3 then the player says fizz instead of their number.
# If the player’s number is divisible by 5 then the player says buzz instead of their number.
# A player must say both fizz and buzz for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5.
# Any player that fails to perform the correct substitution or hesitates before answering is eliminated from the game.
# The last player remaining is the winner. Write a program that displays the answers for the first 100 numbers in the
# Fizz- Buzz game. Each answer should be displayed on its own line.
