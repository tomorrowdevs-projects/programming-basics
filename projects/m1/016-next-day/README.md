# Next Day

Write a program that **reads a date** from the user and **computes its immediate successor**.   
The date will be **entered in numeric form with three separate input statements**: 
- year   
- month
- day


Example:    
- if the user enters values that represent 2019-11-18 the next day is 2019-11-19.  
- If the user enters values that represent 2019-11-30 the next day is 2019-12-01. 
- If the user enters values that represent 2019-12-31 the next day is 2020-01-01. 


Ensure that your program **works correctly for leap years**.
