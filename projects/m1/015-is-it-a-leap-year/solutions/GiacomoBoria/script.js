/*Most years have 365 days. However, the time required for the Earth to orbit the Sun is actually slightly more than that. 
As a result, an extra day, February 29, is included in some years to correct for this difference. 
Such years are referred to as leap years. The rules for determining whether or not a year is a leap year follow: Any year that is divisible by 400 is a leap year. 
Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 100 is not a leap year. â€¢ Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 4 is a leap year.
All other years are not leap years. Write a program that reads a year from the user and displays a message indicating whether or not it is a leap year.*/

const userInputYears = Number(prompt("Type your year (in fomrat YYYY)", 0))

if (userInputYears % 400 == 0 || userInputYears %100 != 0 && userInputYears %4 == 0) {
  alert("The year is leap year");
} else {
  alert("The year isn't a leap year");
}
