# Vowel or Consonant

In this exercise you will create a program that reads a letter of the alphabet from the user.   
If the user enters **a, e, i, o or u** then your program should display a message 
indicating that the entered letter is a **vowel**.  
If the user enters **y** then your program should display a message 
indicating that **sometimes y is a vowel, and sometimes y is a consonant**.   
Otherwise, your program should display a message indicating that **the letter is a consonant**.
