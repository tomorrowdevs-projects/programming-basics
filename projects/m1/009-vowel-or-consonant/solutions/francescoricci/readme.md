# Vowel or Consonant

In this exercise you will create a program that reads a letter of the alphabet from the user. 
If the user enters a, e, i, o or u then your program should display a message indicating that the entered letter is a vowel. 
If the user enters y then your program should display a message indicating that sometimes y is a vowel, and sometimes y is a consonant. 
Otherwise your program should display a message indicating that the letter is a consonant.
