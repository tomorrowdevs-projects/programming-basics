# Day Old Bread
#
# A bakery sells loaves of bread for â‚¬3.49 each. 
# Day old bread is discounted by 60 percent. 
# Write a program that begins by reading the number of loaves of day old bread being purchased from the user. 
# Then your program should display the regular price for the bread, the discount because it is a day old, and the total price. 
# Each of these amounts should be displayed on its own line with an appropriate label. 
# All of the values should be displayed using two decimal places, 
# and the decimal points in all of the numbers should be aligned when reasonable values are entered by the user.

print('Hello USER, ')
