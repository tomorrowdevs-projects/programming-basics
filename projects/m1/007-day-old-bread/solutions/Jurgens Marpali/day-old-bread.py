#A bakery sells loaves of bread for â‚¬3.49 each. 
#Day old bread is discounted by 60 percent. 
#Write a program that begins by reading the number of loaves of day old bread being purchased from the 
#user. 
#Then your program should display the regular price for the bread, the discount because it is a day old, 
#and the total price. 
#Each of these amounts should be displayed on its own line with an appropriate label. 
#All of the values should be displayed using two decimal places, and the decimal points in all of the 
#numbers should be aligned when reasonable values are entered by the user.
