# Roulette Payouts

A roulette wheel has 38 spaces on it. 
Of these spaces, 18 are black, 18 are red, and two are green. 
The green spaces are numbered 0 and 00. The red spaces are numbered 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 30 32, 34 and 36. 
The remaining integers between 1 and 36 are used to number the black spaces.
Many different bets can be placed in roulette. 

We will only consider the following subset of them in this exercise:
- Single number (1 to 36, 0, or 00)
- Red versus Black
- Odd versus Even (Note that 0 and 00 do not pay out for even) 
- 1 to 18 versus 19 to 36

Write a program that simulates a spin of a roulette wheel by using a random number generator. Display the number that was selected and all of the bets that must be payed. 

For example, if 13 is selected then your program should display:

```
The spin resulted in 13...
Pay 13
Pay Black
Pay Odd
Pay 1 to 18
```

If the simulation results in 0 or 00 then your program should display `Pay 0` or `Pay 00` without any further output.
