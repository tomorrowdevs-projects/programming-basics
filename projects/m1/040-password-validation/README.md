# Password Validation

In this exercise you will write a function that determines whether a password is good. 
We will define a good password to be a one that is at least 8 characters long and contains 
at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter, and at least one number. 

Your function should return True if the password passed to it as its only parameter is good. 
Otherwise it should return False. Include a main program that reads a password from the user 
and reports whether it is good. Ensure that your main program only runs when your solution 
has not been imported into another file.
