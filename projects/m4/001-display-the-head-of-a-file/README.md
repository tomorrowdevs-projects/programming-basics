# Display the Head of a File

Unix-based operating systems usually include a tool named head. It displays the first 10 lines of a file whose name is provided as a command line argument. Write a Python program that provides the same behavior. Display an appropriate error message if the file requested by the user does not exist, or if the command line
argument is omitted.
