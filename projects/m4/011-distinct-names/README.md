# Distinct Names

In this exercise, you will create a program that reads every file in the baby names data set described in "Names that Reached Number One" Exercise. 

As your program reads the files, it should keep track of every distinct name used for a boy and every distinct name used for a girl. 

Then your program should output each of these lists of names. 

Neither of the lists
should contain any repeated values.
