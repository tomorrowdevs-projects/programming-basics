# Concatenate Multiple Files

Unix-based operating systems typically include a tool named cat, which is short for concatenate. 

Its purpose is to display the concatenation of one or more files whose names are provided as command line arguments. 

The files are displayed in the same
order that they appear on the command line.


Create a Python program that performs this task. It should generate an appropriate
error message for any file that cannot be displayed, and then proceed to the next file. 

Display an appropriate error message if your program is started without any command line arguments.
