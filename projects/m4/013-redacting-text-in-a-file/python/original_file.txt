Sensitive information is often removed, or redacted, from documents before they are released to the public.
In this exercise you will write a program that redacts all occurrences of sensitive words in a text file by replacing them with asterisks.
Your program should redact sensitive words wherever they occur, even if they occur in the middle of another word.
The list of sensitive words will be provided in a separate file.
