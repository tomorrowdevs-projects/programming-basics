Benny *** tired. Not the normal every day tired from a hard day ** work. The exhausted type ** tired where you're surprised your body *** even move. All ** wanted to do *** sit in front ** the TVput his feet up on the coffee tableand drink a beer. The only issue *** **** ** had forgotten where ** lived. The water rush down the wash and into the slot canyon below. Two hikers had started the day to sunny weather without a cloud in the skybut they hadn't thought to check the weather north ** the canyon. Huge thunderstorms had brought a deluge o rain and produced flash floods heading their way. The two hikers had no idea what *** coming. The song came from the bathroom belting over the sound ** the shower's running water. It *** the same way each day began since ** could remember. It listened intently and concluded **** the singing today *** as terrible as it had ever been. Balloons are pretty and come in different colorsdifferent shapesdifferent sizesand they *** even adjust sizes as needed. But don't make them too big or they might just popand then bye-bye balloon. It'll be gone and lost for the rest ** mankind. They *** serve a variety ** purposesfrom decorating to water balloon wars. You just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them. Twenty-five hours had passed since the incident. It seemed to be a lot longer than ****. That twenty-five hours seemed more like a week in her mind. The fact **** she still *** having trouble comprehending exactly what took place wasn't helping the matter. She thought if she could just get a little rest the entire incident might make a little more sense. Matt told her to reach for the starsbut Veronica thought it *** the most ridiculous advice she'd ever received. Sureit had been well-meaning when ** said itbut she didn't understand why anyone would want to suggest something **** would literally kill you if you actually managed to achieve it. Waiting and watching. It *** all she had done for the past weeks. When you’re locked in a room with nothing but food and drinkthat’s about all you *** do anyway. She watched as birds flew past the window bolted shut. She couldn’t reach it if she wanted toowith **** hole in the floor. She thought she could escape through it but three stories is a bit far down.
