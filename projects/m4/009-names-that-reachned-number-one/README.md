# Names that Reached Number One

Each file in the baby names' data set contains a list of  names, along with the number of times each name was used. 
Entries in the files are ordered from most frequently used to least frequently used. 

The data set includes data for every year from 1880 to 2021.


Write a program that reads every file in the data set and identifies all 
the names that were most popular in at least one year.

Your program should output two lists: one containing the most popular names for boys and the other containing the most
popular names for girls.

Neither of your lists should include any repeated values.
