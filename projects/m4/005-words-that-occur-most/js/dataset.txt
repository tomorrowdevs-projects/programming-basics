Write a program that displays the word (or words) that occur most frequently in a file.

Your program should begin by reading the name of the file from the user.

Then it should process every line in the file.

Each line will need to be split into words, and any leading or trailing punctuation marks will need to be removed from each word.

Your program should also ignore capitalization when counting how many times each word occurs.
