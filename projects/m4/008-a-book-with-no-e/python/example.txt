Example text file.
Write a program that reads a list of words from a file and determines what proportion of the words use each letter of the alphabet.
Display the result for all 26 lettes and include an additional message that identifies the letter that is used in the smallest proportion of the words.
Your program should ignore any punctuation marks that are present in the file and it should treat uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent.
