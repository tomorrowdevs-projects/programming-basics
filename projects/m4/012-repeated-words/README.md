# Repeated Words

Spelling mistakes are only one of many different kinds of errors that might appear in a written work. 

Another error that is common for some writers is a repeated word. 

For example, an author might inadvertently duplicate a word, as shown in the following
sentence:


    At least one value must be entered entered in order to compute the average.

Some word processors will detect this error and identify it when a spelling or grammar check is performed.


In this exercise you will write a program that detects repeated words in a text file. When a repeated word is found your program should display a message that contains the line number and the repeated word.

 Ensure that your program correctly handles the case where the same word appears at the end of one line and the beginning of the following line, as shown in the previous example. 
 
 The name of the file to examine will be provided as the program’s only command line argument.
 
  Display an appropriate error message if the user fails to provide a command line argument, or if an error occurs while processing the file.
