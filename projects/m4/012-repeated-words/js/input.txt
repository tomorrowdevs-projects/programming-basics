It was a dark and stormy night. The wind was howling and the rain was pounding against the windows. Mary was huddled under a blanket on the couch, trying to stay warm and dry.

Suddenly, there was a loud knock at the door. Mary jumped up and hurried to answer it, her heart racing. She cautiously opened the door and peered out into the darkness.

To her surprise, she saw a figure standing there, drenched and shivering. It was her old old friend John, who she hadn't seen in years.

"John! What are you doing here?" she exclaimed.

"I'm sorry to show up like this, but I had nowhere else to go," he replied. "My car broke down on the side of the road and I saw your light on. Can I please come in and use your phone to call a tow truck?"

Mary hesitated for a moment, but then she remembered all the good times they had had together and how much she missed him. She opened the door wider and invited him in.

"Of course, come in and get warm," she said.

As John sat down on the couch and began to dry off, Mary went to the kitchen to make some hot cocoa. She was so happy to see him again, she forgot all about the storm raging outside.

But as she was stirring the cocoa, she suddenly remembered something important. She had left her phone in the bedroom and she needed to get it to call the tow truck.

She rushed back to the living room to tell John, but as she entered the room, she saw that he had fallen asleep. She didn't want to wake him, so she decided to just let him rest and figure out a plan in the morning.

As Mary settled back on the couch, she couldn't help but smile to herself. It was nice to have an old old friend back in her life, even if it was under strange circumstances. This is a test
