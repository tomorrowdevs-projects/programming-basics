The chief's achievement, however, did not go unnoticed by the higher-ups. They were impressed with the chief's leadership and they decided to promote him to a higher position. The chief, however, was hesitant to leave his team as he was aware of the fact that they were a close-knit group who had achieved great success together.

The higher-ups, however, were insistent and they made him an offer he could not refuse. The chief had no choice but to accept the promotion and leave his team. The team was heartbroken, as they knew that without the chief's guidance, they would not be able to achieve the same level of success.
