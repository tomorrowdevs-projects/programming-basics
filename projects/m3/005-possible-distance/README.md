# Possible Change

Create a program that determines whether it is possible to construct a particular total using a specific number of coins. 

For example, it is possible to have a total of $1.00 using four coins if they are all quarters. 

However, there is no way to have a total of $1.00 using 5 coins. 
Yet it is possible to have $1.00 using 6 coins by using 3 quarters, 2 dimes and a nickel. 

Similarly, a total of $1.25 can be formed using 5
coins or 8 coins, but a total of $1.25 cannot be formed using 4, 6 or 7 coins.

Your program should read both the dollar amount and the number of coins from the user. 

Then it should display a clear message indicating whether the entered dollar amount can be formed 
using the number of coins indicated. 

Assume the existence of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies when completing this problem. 

Your solution must use recursion. It cannot contain any loops.
