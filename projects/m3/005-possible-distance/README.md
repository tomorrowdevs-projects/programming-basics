# Possible Change

Create a program that determines whether or not it is possible to construct a particular total using a specific number of coins. 

For example, it is possible to have a total of $1.00 using four coins if they are all quarters. 

However, there is no way to have a total of $1.00 using 5 coins. Yet it is possible to have $1.00 using 6 coins by using 3 quarters, 2 dimes and a nickel. 

Similarly, a total of $1.25 can be formed using 5
coins or 8 coins, but a total of $1.25 cannot be formed using 4, 6 or 7 coins.

Your program should read both the dollar amount and the number of coins from the user. 

Then it should display a clear message indicating whether or not the entered dollar amount can be formed using the number of coins indicated. 

Assume the exis- tence of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies when completing this problem. 

Your solution must use recursion. It cannot contain any loops.
