# Run-Length Decoding

Run-length encoding is a simple data compression technique that can be effective 
when repeated values occur at adjacent positions within a list. 

Compression is achieved by replacing groups of repeated values with one copy of the value, 
followed by the number of times that it should be repeated.   
For example, the list  
`["A", "A", "A", "A", "A", "A", "A", "A", "A", "A", "A", "A", "B", "B", "B","B","A","A","A","A","A","A","B"]`  
would be compressed as `["A",12,"B",4,"A",6,"B",1]`. 

Decompression is performed by replicating each value in the list the number of times indicated.

Write a recursive function that decompresses a run-length encoded list. 
Your recursive function will take a run-length compressed list as its only argument. 
It will return the decompressed list as its only result. 

Create a main program that displays a run-length encoded list and the result of decoding it.
