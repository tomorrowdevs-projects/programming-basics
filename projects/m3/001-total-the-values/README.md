# Total the Values

Write a program that reads values from the user until a blank line is entered. Display the total of all of the values entered by the user (or 0.0 if the first value entered is a blank line). 

Complete this task using recursion. 

Your program may not use any
loops.

Hint: The body of your recursive function will need to read one value from the user, and then determine whether or not to make a recursive call. Your function does not need to take any arguments, but it will need to return a numeric result.
